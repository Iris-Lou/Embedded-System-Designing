## 1. memory_test:
      Design the data memory tester of IAP15W4K58S4 singlechip, you need to achieve the following functions:
  (1) If switch K1 is off, switch K2 is on, test whether the unit of the internal data memory 00-FFH of the singlechip functions properly.<br>
(&nbsp;)If all the memory cells function properly, turn on indicator L1 and write 0AAH to the memory cell 89H.<br>
(&nbsp;)If there is an error, L1 flash and write 55H to memory cell 89H.<br>
  (2) If switch K2 is on, switch K1 is off, test whether off-chip memory works properly. <br>
(&nbsp;)If all the memory cells function properly, turn on L2 and write 0AAH to 800H in the off-chip memory.<br>
(&nbsp;)If there is an error, L2 flash and write 55H to 800H in the off-chip memory.<br>
  (3) The switches K1 and K2 are all off or on, the detection is stopped, and the indicator lights L1 and L2 are off.<br>
  
(&nbsp;) Draw circuit schematics and write programs. Briefly describe whether the test program is written in the correct way.
